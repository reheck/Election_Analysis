# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
### A representative from the Colorado Election Committee needs the 2017 congressional election results audited and analyzed. The final output of this analysis must be a simple summary table identifying the total number of votes, breakdown of votes in each county, the county's name with the greatest voter turnout, and the winner of the election.
